                        Simply scroll through the following pages to learn all about the strengths and benefits of our
                        urban forest, as well as the opportunities and challenges that it currently faces.
                    </p>

                    <p>Publicly and privately-owned forests combine to create an urban tree canopy that provides
                        numerous benefits to city residents, businesses, students, and visitors.
                        <br><br>
                        These benefits come from significant contributions to stormwater management, public health
                        improvement, energy use reduction, air pollution abatement, and overall quality of life. These
                        ecosystem, economic, and social services provided by trees become even more important to
                        Bloomington as the City grows and changes with time.</p>
                    <p>Recognizing the value of the urban forest, the City of Bloomington has assessed the extent of the
                        current total tree canopy and conducted a public tree inventory. An analysis of this information
                        answers the question “What do we have.” The City will begin planning the next steps in the
                        city’s effort to proactively plan for and manage this valuable asset. Those questions are “What
                        do we want” and “How do we get there.”</p>
                    <p>The following pages and interactive maps will show you information about current urban forest
                        conditions in Bloomington via the urban tree canopy data analysis and tree inventory findings.

                    <p>The urban tree canopy (UTC) analysis found that 38% of Bloomington is covered by tree canopy,
                        while 34% of the city is covered by impervious surfaces (roads, buildings) that repel stormwater
                        and contribute to heat island effects. The remaining land in the city is previous areas of low

                    <ul>According to U.S. Forest Service Research Forester, Greg McPherson (AmericanForests.org), canopy
                        goals are best developed on a city-by-city basis and should consider constraints to creating
                        canopy such as:
                        <li>Development densities (i.e., dense development patterns with more impervious surfaces have
                            less opportunity for cover)</li>
                        <li>Land use patterns (i.e., residential areas may have more opportunity for canopy than
                            commercial areas, but the canopy cover tends to be lower in residential areas of
                            disadvantaged communities versus wealthy ones)</li>
                        <li>Ordinances (i.e., parking lot shade ordinances promote cover over some impervious areas);
                            and climate (i.e., canopy cover in desert cities is often less than tropical cities)</li>

                <div class="sm-textbox">

                    <p>The overall health of Bloomington’s urban ecosystem depends greatly on the ability of trees,
                        plants, wildlife, insects, and humans to interact as a whole. Ecosystem health declines when
                        there is urban build-up and land clearing that results in tree removals and a decrease in
                        overall tree canopy cover.
                        <br><br>Land development often causes tree canopies to be fragmented and leads to a decline in
                        habitat quality and canopy connectivity. In turn, this decline results in decreased wildlife
                        populations and increased risk and susceptibility to non-native, invasive plants and insects,
                        and disease to both woodlands and landscapes in the city.</p>

                    <ul>Bloomington has approximately 5,735 acres of tree canopy in four classifications, establishing
                        the following baseline measures for the city:
                        <li>Core Canopy and Perforated Canopy - This is a high quality, high-functioning forestland and
                            represents 17% of Bloomington’s forests. Because of small clearings within them, perforated
                            areas of the canopy are just beginning to lose connectivity with large forest tracts.</li>
                        <li>Edge Canopy - This type of forest is defined as the boundary between core forests and large
                            tracts of developed and non-forested land. This category accounts for 28% of Bloomington’s
                            canopy.</li>
                        <li>Patch Canopy -This classification is for tree canopy that comprises a small forested area
                            that is surrounded by non-forested land cover. This category of forests is the least
                            productive and beneficial and comprises 55% of Bloomington’s urban tree canopy.
                        </li>
                    </ul>


                    <p>Knowing the locations of the forest types can guide land acquisition decisions and tree planting
                        priorities so that these kinds of efforts are targeted in areas that can connect isolated areas
                        of trees to create more contiguous and larger urban forests tracts.

                    <p>The overall health of trees has a direct impact on the sustainability of Bloomington’s urban
                        forest. Trees in worse condition require more maintenance, are more susceptible to insect and
                        disease problems, and can present a health and safety risk to the public. Trees in better
                        condition require less maintenance, are less prone to storm damage, look better, and provide
                        maximum environmental services to the city.</p>



                    <p>Using the citywide UTC data, a relative health assessment established a benchmark that over 39%
                        of the urban tree canopy could be in Good and Very Good health. Almost 35% was classified as in
                        Fair health, and approximately 24% of the canopy is in relatively Poor health or Dead.
                    </p>

                    <p>Trees growing in an urban environment face many challenges that threaten their vigor, increase
                        risk, and shorten their service lives: poor soil quality, restricted rooting area, air
                        pollution, increased temperatures, construction damage, vehicular accidents, soil compaction,
                        drought stress, and stress-induced insect and disease infestations. Of particular concern for
                        Bloomington are remnant issues from its emerald ash borer and and future issues from climate
                        change.</p>
                    <p>If unmanaged, these risks to forest health may result in the trees that are in Fair condition
                        falling into the Poor/Dead classification. For the entire urban forest, this puts over half of
                        Bloomington’s canopy at an elevated risk. The city and property owners should stay aware of
                        these threats and understand the best actions they can take to protect the tree canopy on public
                        and private property.</p>

                    <p>While comprehensive urban forest management considers all trees across the entire jurisdiction
                        and takes action to improve the condition and extent of the citywide urban tree canopy, the City
                        of Bloomington’s primary responsibility is to properly manage public trees. Therefore, an
                        important step in developing proactive management strategies is to assess the current
                        composition and distribution of Bloomington’s public trees and their associated ecosystem
                        services.</p>

                    <ul>From February to August 2019, a team of DRG staff assessed and inventoried trees, stumps, and
                        planting sites along the public street ROW and select parks:
                        <li>24,371 sites were inventoried</li>
                        <li>19,013 trees (17,541 street and 1,472 park)</li>
                        <li>741 stumps
                        </li>
                        <li>4,617 planting sites</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Species diversity is high. The mix of species in Blooming’s publicly-managed trees is 168 species
                        representing 63 genera. Red maple is present within the population at 13%. The other four of the
                        top five include callery pear, northern red oak, and sugar maple. Species diversity, or the
                        number and variety of species in a specific population, affects the tree population’s ability to
                        withstand threats from invasive pests and diseases. Species diversity also impacts tree
                        maintenance needs and costs, tree planting goals, and canopy continuity and resiliency.
                    </p>
                    <p>Condition of the population is healthy. Overall, the vast majority (92%) of Bloomington’s public
                        trees are in Fair or Good condition. At the time of the inventory, only 8% of trees were either
                        identified as Poor or Dead. Condition is an important tree attribute to know and monitor as it
                        indicates how well trees are performing, their susceptibility to insect and disease threats,
                        both short-term and long-term maintenance needs and costs, risk level, and the outlook for urban
                        tree canopy cover continuity.</p>
                    <p>Maintenance remains a priority for the city. Only 6% of the public trees should be removed, 12%
                        require pruning, 37% require routine inspections and pruning, 25% of the young trees need
                        structural pruning, and 23% could be planted.</p>
                    <p>The following parks were included in this analysis: Bryan Park, Building Trades, Butler Park,
                        Lower Cascades, Miller Showers Park, Olcott Park, Peoples Park, Rose Hill Cemetery, Seminary
                        Park, Twin Lakes Recreation Center and Sports Complex, and White Oak Cemetery</p>

                    <p>There is not a universal tree canopy goal that applies to all cities. Communities should instead
                        create their own goals based on a number of factors, including what is possible and given local
                        economic, development, and environmental goals and constraints.</p>

                    <p>The suggestion is to choose a tree canopy goal that achieves specific objectives, such as
                        reaching the canopy percentage necessary to reduce urban heat island temperatures to a specific
                        range, or to reduce stormwater runoff by a projected amount. At 38%, Bloomington's citywide tree
                        canopy is compares well with other similar communities like State College, Pennsylvania (39%),
                        Columbia, Missouri (35%) and Ann Arbor, Michigan (33%), the challenge now is to maintain or grow
                        that canopy as the city and citizens desire.</p>

                        but also reflect the city’s dedication to providing a high quality of life and effectively using
                        municipal resources to do so. A sustainable public tree population in the city will provide
                        maximum benefits to citizens, workers, and visitors, and require less resources to keep it safe
                        and healthy.</p>

                    <p>In general, a sustainable urban forest is a forest where the trees are of different ages and
                        diverse with species well-suited to site conditions, and that are insect and disease resistant
                        and low maintenance. A tree population meeting these criteria is sustainable, resilient, and

                    <p>'We cannot separate sustainable urban forests from the people who live in and around them.
                        Sustainable urban forests are not born, they are made. They do not arise at random, but result
                        from a community-wide commitment to their creation and management. Obtaining the commitment of a
                        broad community, of numerous constituencies, cannot be dictated or legislated. It must arise out

                    <p>Bloomington’s vision to promote and preserve the urban forest and improve the management of public trees was a fundamental inspiration for this project. This vision will ensure canopy continuity, which will reduce stormwater runoff and energy use and improve aesthetic value, air quality, and public health.</p>

                    <p>Sammamish’s existing citywide tree canopy provides residents with $4 million in benefits
                        annually. In addition to the annual benefits, the carbon stored by the current UTC contributes
                        an additional $28 million in benefits, bringing the collective benefit amount to $32 million.
                        This information was calculated using models and methods derived from <a

                    <p>This City of Sammamish has mapped the watershed sub-basins as a key approach to managing the
                        local environment. Knowledge about the UTC within these areas provides a benchmark for
                        understanding and optimizing stormwater mitigation benefits and other environmental services.
