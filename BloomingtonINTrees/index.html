                <br><br>

                Simply scroll through the following pages to learn all about the strengths and benefits of our
                urban forest, as well as the opportunities and challenges that it currently faces.
            </p>

            <p>Publicly and privately-owned forests combine to create an urban tree canopy that provides
                numerous benefits to city residents, businesses, students, and visitors.
                <br><br>
                These benefits come from significant contributions to stormwater management, public health
                improvement, energy use reduction, air pollution abatement, and overall quality of life. These
                ecosystem, economic, and social services provided by trees become even more important to
                Bloomington as the City grows and changes with time.</p>
            <p>Recognizing the value of the urban forest, the City of Bloomington has assessed the extent of the
                current total tree canopy and conducted a public tree inventory. An analysis of this information
                answers the question “What do we have.” The City will begin planning the next steps in the
                city’s effort to proactively plan for and manage this valuable asset. Those questions are “What
                do we want” and “How do we get there.”</p>
            <p>The following pages and interactive maps will show you information about current urban forest
                conditions in Bloomington via the urban tree canopy data analysis and tree inventory findings.

                <p>The urban tree canopy (UTC) analysis found that 38% of Bloomington is covered by tree canopy,
                    while 34% of the city is covered by impervious surfaces (roads, buildings) that repel stormwater
                    and contribute to heat island effects. The remaining land in the city is previous areas of low

                <ul>According to U.S. Forest Service Research Forester, Greg McPherson (AmericanForests.org), canopy
                    goals are best developed on a city-by-city basis and should consider constraints to creating
                    canopy such as:
                    <li>Development densities (i.e., dense development patterns with more impervious surfaces have
                        less opportunity for cover)</li>
                    <li>Land use patterns (i.e., residential areas may have more opportunity for canopy than
                        commercial areas, but the canopy cover tends to be lower in residential areas of
                        disadvantaged communities versus wealthy ones)</li>
                    <li>Ordinances (i.e., parking lot shade ordinances promote cover over some impervious areas);
                        and climate (i.e., canopy cover in desert cities is often less than tropical cities)</li>

            <div class="sm-textbox">

                <p>The overall health of Bloomington’s urban ecosystem depends greatly on the ability of trees,
                    plants, wildlife, insects, and humans to interact as a whole. Ecosystem health declines when
                    there is urban build-up and land clearing that results in tree removals and a decrease in
                    overall tree canopy cover.
                    <br><br>Land development often causes tree canopies to be fragmented and leads to a decline in
                    habitat quality and canopy connectivity. In turn, this decline results in decreased wildlife
                    populations and increased risk and susceptibility to non-native, invasive plants and insects,
                    and disease to both woodlands and landscapes in the city.</p>

                <ul>Bloomington has approximately 5,735 acres of tree canopy in four classifications, establishing
                    the following baseline measures for the city:
                    <li>Core Canopy and Perforated Canopy - This is a high quality, high-functioning forestland and
                        represents 17% of Bloomington’s forests. Because of small clearings within them, perforated
                        areas of the canopy are just beginning to lose connectivity with large forest tracts.</li>
                    <li>Edge Canopy - This type of forest is defined as the boundary between core forests and large
                        tracts of developed and non-forested land. This category accounts for 28% of Bloomington’s
                        canopy.</li>
                    <li>Patch Canopy -This classification is for tree canopy that comprises a small forested area
                        that is surrounded by non-forested land cover. This category of forests is the least
                        productive and beneficial and comprises 55% of Bloomington’s urban tree canopy.
                    </li>
                </ul>


                <p>Knowing the locations of the forest types can guide land acquisition decisions and tree planting
                    priorities so that these kinds of efforts are targeted in areas that can connect isolated areas
                    of trees to create more contiguous and larger urban forests tracts.

                    disease problems, and can present a health and safety risk to the public. Trees in better
                    condition require less maintenance, are less prone to storm damage, look better, and provide
                    maximum environmental services to the city.</p>



                <p>Using the citywide UTC data, a relative health assessment established a benchmark that over 39%

                    Fair health, and approximately 24% of the canopy is in relatively Poor health or Dead.
                </p>

                <p>Trees growing in an urban environment face many challenges that threaten their vigor, increase
                    risk, and shorten their service lives: poor soil quality, restricted rooting area, air
                    pollution, increased temperatures, construction damage, vehicular accidents, soil compaction,
                    drought stress, and stress-induced insect and disease infestations. Of particular concern for
                    Bloomington are remnant issues from its emerald ash borer and and future issues from climate
                    change.</p>
                <p>If unmanaged, these risks to forest health may result in the trees that are in Fair condition
                    falling into the Poor/Dead classification. For the entire urban forest, this puts over half of
                    Bloomington’s canopy at an elevated risk. The city and property owners should stay aware of
                    these threats and understand the best actions they can take to protect the tree canopy on public
                    and private property.</p>

                <ul>From February to August 2019, a team of DRG staff assessed and inventoried trees, stumps, and
                    planting sites along the public street ROW and select parks:
                    <li>24,371 sites were inventoried</li>
                    <li>19,013 trees (17,541 street and 1,472 park)</li>
                    <li>741 stumps
                    </li>
                    <li>4,617 planting sites</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Species diversity is high. The mix of species in Blooming’s publicly-managed trees is 168 species
                    representing 63 genera. Red maple is present within the population at 13%. The other four of the
                    top five include callery pear, northern red oak, and sugar maple. Species diversity, or the
                    number and variety of species in a specific population, affects the tree population’s ability to
                    withstand threats from invasive pests and diseases. Species diversity also impacts tree
                    maintenance needs and costs, tree planting goals, and canopy continuity and resiliency.
                </p>
                <p>Condition of the population is healthy. Overall, the vast majority (92%) of Bloomington’s public
                    trees are in Fair or Good condition. At the time of the inventory, only 8% of trees were either
                    identified as Poor or Dead. Condition is an important tree attribute to know and monitor as it
                    indicates how well trees are performing, their susceptibility to insect and disease threats,
                    both short-term and long-term maintenance needs and costs, risk level, and the outlook for urban
                    tree canopy cover continuity.</p>
                <p>Maintenance remains a priority for the city. Only 6% of the public trees should be removed, 12%
                    require pruning, 37% require routine inspections and pruning, 25% of the young trees need
                    structural pruning, and 23% could be planted.</p>
                <p>The following parks were included in this analysis: Bryan Park, Building Trades, Butler Park,
                    Lower Cascades, Miller Showers Park, Olcott Park, Peoples Park, Rose Hill Cemetery, Seminary

                <p>There is not a universal tree canopy goal that applies to all cities. Communities should instead
                    create their own goals based on a number of factors, including what is possible and given local
                    economic, development, and environmental goals and constraints.</p>

                <p>The suggestion is to choose a tree canopy goal that achieves specific objectives, such as
                    reaching the canopy percentage necessary to reduce urban heat island temperatures to a specific
                    range, or to reduce stormwater runoff by a projected amount. At 38%, Bloomington's citywide tree
                    canopy is compares well with other similar communities like State College, Pennsylvania (39%),
                    Columbia, Missouri (35%) and Ann Arbor, Michigan (33%), the challenge now is to maintain or grow
                    that canopy as the city and citizens desire.</p>

                <p>The trees in parks and along the streets of Bloomington should not only be attractive and safe,
                    but also reflect the city’s dedication to providing a high quality of life and effectively using
                    municipal resources to do so. A sustainable public tree population in the city will provide
                    maximum benefits to citizens, workers, and visitors, and require less resources to keep it safe
                    and healthy.</p>

                <p>In general, a sustainable urban forest is a forest where the trees are of different ages and
                    diverse with species well-suited to site conditions, and that are insect and disease resistant
                    and low maintenance. A tree population meeting these criteria is sustainable, resilient, and
                    produces maximum social, economic, and ecological benefits for the community.</p>


                <p>'We cannot separate sustainable urban forests from the people who live in and around them.
                    Sustainable urban forests are not born, they are made. They do not arise at random, but result
                    from a community-wide commitment to their creation and management. Obtaining the commitment of a
                    broad community, of numerous constituencies, cannot be dictated or legislated. It must arise out

                    the path of a more sustainable, resilient, and equitable urban forest. Two toolkits with guiding
                    principles for urban forest planning may be of interest to the planning committees,

                <ul>Common planning goals include:
                    <li>Managing a diverse, sustainable, safe, and beneficial community forest;
                    </li>
                    <li>Maintaining and expanding the urban tree canopy now and for future generations;
                    </li>
                    <li>Using professional urban forestry leadership and staff, proper maintenance and planting
                        techniques, more efficient management of city resources, and greater public education so
                        that the city’s urban forest is viewed as an important community asset;

                    </li>
                    <li>Having the urban forest uniquely define the city’s character and be a major factor in the
                        continued growth and livability of Bloomington.</li>

                <p>Bloomington’s vision to promote and preserve the urban forest and improve the management of
                    public trees was a fundamental inspiration for this project. This vision will ensure canopy
                    continuity, which will reduce stormwater runoff and energy use and improve aesthetic value, air
                    quality, and public health.</p>
