*Before posting to live*

run this command on the terminal to build the dist (babel)folder
npm run build

This will hopefully translate the js so that it runs on other platforms
(Like IOS hopefully)

**IF EVERYTHING IS BROKEN**

Close the project and open the folder that holds the project folder
All the source links include /BloomingtonIN because that is what the url is when live
So when we open it, we need to open one folder previous and select BloomingtonIN
That way the url is the same
