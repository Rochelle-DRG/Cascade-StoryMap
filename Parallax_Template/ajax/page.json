Almost 14% was classified as in Fair health, and approximately 9% of the canopy is in relatively Poor health or Dead.  Trees growing in an urban environment face many challenges that threaten their vigor, increase risk, and shorten their service lives: poor soil quality, restricted rooting area, air pollution, increased temperatures, construction damage, vehicular accidents, soil compaction, drought stress, and stress-induced insect and disease infestations.  Of particular concern for Sammamish are remnant issues from its logging history, including specific concerns over Laminated Root Rot and other diseases affecting native trees.",
