Trees growing in an urban environment face many challenges that threaten their vigor, increase risk, and shorten their service lives: poor soil quality, restricted rooting area, air pollution, increased temperatures, construction damage, vehicular accidents, soil compaction, drought stress, and stress-induced insect and disease infestations.
